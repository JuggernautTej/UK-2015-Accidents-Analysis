With this project, I sought to polish my skills in SQL using MySQL workbench. The data on this project is sourced from
the UK's Department of Transport's open database, https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data, which I used to determine the amount of accidents and the associated severity for all vehicles
as well as statistics on the accients caused by Motorcycles. This project helped me work on importing data into MySQL workbench by getting me acquinted with the
syntax for doing so.

## Questions that were answered
1. What the median severity value of accidents caused by various Motorcyles was?
2. What the Accident Severity and Total Accidents per Vehicle Type were?
3. What the Average Accident Severity for Motorbikes? and Total Accidents caused by Motorbikes
